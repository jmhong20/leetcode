You are given an array **score**, where **score[i]** stores the score of an **ith** athelete. 
Higher score means better result: an athelete with the highest score will receive a gold medal, an athelete with the second highest score will receive a silver medal, and so on.

After the third highest athelete receives a bronze medal, rest of the players will receive a **rank** of their index.
For example, fourth highest athelete will receive a rank of **4**, fifth highest athelete will receive a rank of **5**, and so on.

You need to return a **rank** array that stores the rank of **ith** player corresponding to **score[i]**.
